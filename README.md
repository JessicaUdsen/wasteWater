OECD Waste Water App
================
This is a basic Shiny app made with the OECD Waste Water Data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/oecd-waste-water-treatment/)
The data can be filtered by country and variable of interest, and can be viewed in time series or tabular form. 
At some point, I am hoping to add a chloropleth map function.
